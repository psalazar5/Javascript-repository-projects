<h1>Projects</h1>
<ul>

<h2>Pizza-menu</h2>

<p>This project is a menu used to order pizza. It contains various selections of toppings with sizes from personal to xl <br>
It then takes the input information and calculates the price for the order</p>

<h2>Tic-tac-toe Game</h2>

<p>This is a classic tic-tac-toe game. Randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first.<br>
 Users can decide which token each player wants to use. <br>
 The winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights with the line going through the winners O or X.</p>

 <h2>Calculator</h2>
 <p>Basic 4 function calculator. Uses multiplication, division, subtraction and addition on a sleek web version calculator.</p>
 
<h2> What this knowledge helped me with: </h2>

This course and projects brought a lot of trial and error while learning, nothing was easy and I took myself out of my comfort zone to understand what these languages can do at a fundamental base of learning the front end. These projects tremendously endured me to overcoming a lot more trial and error projects that I had ahead of me such as my C# course and projects : <a href= "https://github.com/psalazar5/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects" > Here </a>. With that being said it brought a lot of trial and error as mentioned and displayed my work process through it all meaning I learned how to solve problems that were not easy but I was able to over come.
